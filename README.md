# Agent Innovator Lab

The Agent Innovator Lab is designed to provide a structured learning experience for AI agent development by leveraging Microsoft Azure's core services (Data & AI, App, and Infra). Each lab focuses on a specific topic, covering areas such as search algorithm optimization, agentic design patterns, and evaluation frameworks. Through this hands-on workshop, participants will gain practical experience in building, optimizing, and evaluating Azure-based AI agents, ultimately driving innovation and enhancing real-world AI system deployment.
This repository includes RAG best practices, along with tools and techniques for innovating current architecture. 


This hands-on lab is suitable for the following purposes:

1. 1-day workshop (4-7 hours depending on customer)
2. Hackathon starter code
3. Reference guide for Evaluation-driven Multi-Agent design patterns

## ðŸ”¥ New Feature (Oct. 14, 2025)

### MS Agent Framework hands-on lab<br>
- This hands-on demonstrates how to build agentic AI applications using **Microsoft Agent Framework**, the unified evolution of Semantic Kernel and AutoGen.
- The lab covers the following topics:
    - **Core concepts and architecture**: Chat agents, tools & functions, multi-agent orchestration, and open standards (MCP, A2A, OpenAPI)
    - **What's different from SK/AutoGen**: Simplified agent creation, native thread management, inline tool registration, and built-in observability
    - **Agentic Design Patterns Implementation**:
        - **Reflection Pattern (Adaptive RAG)**: Implements quality-driven workflows with Worker-Reviewer cycles, featuring intent classification, retrieval grading, and automatic query rewriting for improved response quality
        - **Plan-and-Execute Pattern**: Demonstrates task decomposition with sequential and parallel workflow orchestration, enabling complex multi-step operations through intelligent planning and execution
        - **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Explores three collaboration patterns - Group Chat (turn-based refinement), Concurrent Execution (parallel analysis), and Magentic Orchestration (intelligent coordination for complex tasks)
    - **Azure Integration**: Seamless integration with Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search, Azure Evaluation SDK, and Azure AI Foundry Agent Service
- Each pattern includes step-by-step implementation, real-world use cases, and best practices for production deployment

## ðŸ”¥ New Feature (Apr. 10, 2025)

### Prompt Optimization using PromptWizard<br>
- This hands-on demonstrates how to optimize prompts using PromptWizard. PromptWizard, released as open source and paper by Microsoft, is a prompt optimization tool for maximizing the performance of LLM. It is a prompt optimization framework that employs a self-evolving mechanism in which LLM generates, critiques, refines, and continuously improves prompts and examples through feedback and synthesis

### Semantic Kernel hands-on lab<br>
- This hands-on demonstrates how to use Semantic Kernel (SK) to build a simple agentic application.
- The lab covers the following topics:
    - Core concepts and architecture of Semantic Kernel (SK)
- Agent implementation examples:
    - Azure AI Agent, Azure Assistant Agent, Chat Completion Agent, Azure Responses Agent
- Tool and connector integration:
    - Azure AI Search, File Tool, Bing Search API via Bing Search Connector, Bing Grounding Tool, Azure Evaluation SDK 
- How to build a simple agentic application using SK, leveraging various agentic design patterns (e.g. Corrective / Adaptive RAG)
- You can also leverage existing evaluation design patterns and optimization design patterns to evaluate and optimize your Semantic Kernel application.

## Trouble Shooting

### EvaluationException: (UserError) Failed to connect to your Azure AI project. Please check if the project scope is configured correctly, and make sure you have the necessary access permissions. Status code: 401.
- run `az login`. To set up your tenant scope, try the option `--scope https://graph.microsoft.com//.default`
- For example, `az login --scope https://graph.microsoft.com//.default`

### azure_ai_project evaluationexception: (internalerror) azure ml managed identity configuration not found in environment. invalid_scope
- Check the managed identity role that your compute instance has. You can create a **compute instance on Azure AI Foundry (not on Azure ML)** to avoid the complex identity setup.
