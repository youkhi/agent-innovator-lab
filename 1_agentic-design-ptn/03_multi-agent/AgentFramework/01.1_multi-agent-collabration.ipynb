    "\n",
    "## What is Multi-Agent Collaboration?\n",
    "Multi-Agent Collaboration refers to the process where multiple autonomous agents—each capable of independent decision-making—work together to achieve common or complementary objectives. This concept is widely used in fields like artificial intelligence, robotics, distributed computing, and simulation, and it involves several key aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Effective Communication and Coordination**:\n",
    "Agents exchange information and align their actions to collectively achieve a goal, ensuring that tasks are organized and synchronized.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Autonomous, Distributed Decision-Making**:\n",
    "Each agent operates independently, making local decisions while contributing to a broader strategy, which enhances flexibility and fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adaptive Task Specialization**:\n",
    "Agents focus on specific roles or subtasks based on their capabilities, and they adjust their strategies through iterative feedback, leading to improved overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Advantages\n",
    "- **Efficiency Through Task Specialization**:\n",
    "By assigning specific roles to different agents, the system can handle complex tasks in parallel. This specialization allows each agent to focus on its area of expertise, resulting in faster and more effective problem-solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability and Flexibility**:\n",
    "Structured communication and dynamic task allocation enable the system to scale easily. It can adapt to varying project complexities by adding or reassigning agents as needed, ensuring that the collaboration remains robust even as demands change.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Iterative Refinement**:\n",
    "Built-in feedback loops and iterative dialogue facilitate continuous improvement. Agents can refine their outputs based on real-time feedback, leading to more accurate and cohesive final results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Three Multi-Agent Patterns in Microsoft Agent Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates three powerful multi-agent collaboration patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern | Description | Use Case |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Group Chat** | Sequential conversation with turn-based interaction | Collaborative refinement, approval workflows |\n",
    "| **Concurrent Execution** | Parallel execution with fan-out/fan-in | Independent parallel analysis, diverse perspectives |\n",
    "| **Magentic Orchestration** | Intelligent orchestration with planning | Complex multi-step tasks, research + execution |\n",

      "\n",
      "1) **NVIDIA H100 GPU Instance Hourly Rates for Self-Hosting DeepSeek-7B**  \n",
      "- The NVIDIA H100 is a high-end GPU designed primarily for AI and HPC workloads, with availability in cloud providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and specialized AI platforms.  \n",
      "- Hourly rates for an instance equipped with the H100 vary by provider and region but generally range from approximately **$4.50 to $7.00 per hour** for a single GPU instance optimized for AI workloads. For example:  \n",
      "  - **AWS EC2 p5 Instances** with H100 GPUs: Approximately $6.00–$7.00/hr (on-demand).  \n",
      "  - **Azure ND H100 v5 Series**: Pricing around $5.00–$6.00/hr (varies by region).  \n",
      "  - Some AI-focused providers or dedicated servers may offer slightly lower pricing but with varying support and SLAs.  \n",
      "- Self-hosting DeepSeek-7B on such an instance would also require consideration of additional costs like storage, networking, and persistent compute instances. DeepSeek-7B (a 7-billion parameter model) fits comfortably on a single H100 GPU, which has ample memory (up to 80 GB in the PCIe version) for efficient inference, lowering the need for multiple GPUs.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2) **Azure OpenAI Pricing for GPT-4.1-mini Per 1K Tokens**  \n",
      "- Azure OpenAI has introduced various GPT-4 series models, and prices vary depending on the model complexity and capability.  \n",
      "- As of mid-2024, pricing for GPT-4 variants on Azure OpenAI roughly follows this tier:  \n",
      "  - GPT-4 (standard): around **$0.03 per 1,000 prompt tokens** and **$0.06 per 1,000 completion tokens**.  \n",
      "  - GPT-4.1-mini, being a lighter/smaller variant, is cheaper, with approximate pricing at **$0.012 to $0.015 per 1,000 tokens** (combined prompt + completion or sometimes charged separately with roughly equal pricing). Azure does not always list mini versions publicly, but inferences from available pricing and reduced model complexity suggest this range.  \n",
      "- For exact pricing, Azure OpenAI portal or API pricing page should be checked, as pricing can change based on volumes and negotiated enterprise agreements.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) **Average Response Time and Throughput Benchmarks for Both Setups on 1K-Token Prompts**  \n",
      "- **Self-hosted DeepSeek-7B on NVIDIA H100**:  \n",
      "  - Latency: Typically ranges from **1.5 to 3 seconds** per 1,000-token prompt + completion depending on batch size and optimization (e.g., FP16 inference, TensorRT optimizations).  \n",
      "  - Throughput: Can handle **~10 to 20+ requests per minute** depending on concurrency and instance capabilities.  \n",
      "  - These are rough benchmarks from user reports and industry benchmarks for similar-sized models on H100-class GPUs.  \n",
      "- **Azure OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini**:  \n",
      "  - Latency: Average response time generally around **1 to 2 seconds** for 1K tokens, benefiting from large-scale GPU clusters and optimized serving pipelines. Latencies under 1 second have been reported for smaller payloads, but complexity and token length influence this.  \n",
      "  - Throughput: High throughput capabilities due to cloud scaling, often **hundreds of requests per minute**, depending on API rate limits and concurrency levels.  \n",
      "- Overall, cloud managed services tend to offer better throughput and lower operational latency variability due to massive infrastructure optimization. Self-hosting can be optimized with engineering but requires significant effort.\n",

Higher DevOps overhead. | Maintained by Azure. No infrastructure or model updates required by the user. Automatic patching, monitoring, and scaling. Lower operational burden. |\n",
      "| **Scalability** | Limited by owned hardware or paid cloud instances; scaling horizontally requires provisioning more expensive GPU nodes and handling distributed inference logic. Storage & bandwidth need management. | Virtually unlimited scalability backed by Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure. Auto-scaling based on usage, no upfront hardware commitment. Flexible pay-as-you-go pricing. |\n",
      "| **Customization** | Full control over model fine-tuning, serving stack, low-level optimizations, and ability to deploy custom versions or tweaks. | Limited to provided API parameters. Cannot alter underlying model weights or hosting setup. |\n",
      "| **Cost Predictability** | Potentially cost-effective at high, stable workloads but risk of underutilization or over-provisioning. Requires upfront investment or reserved instances for cost reduction. | Predictable costs with pay-per-use. Suitable for variable workloads due to scaling flexibility. |\n",
      "| **Security & Compliance** | Complete control over data and environment, which can be essential for strict compliance. Requires robust security implementation. | Built-in compliance certifications, encrypted data handling, but involves trusting third party with data. |\n",

    "## 🎓 What You Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Group Chat Pattern**\n",
    "   - Sequential turn-based communication\n",
    "   - Custom termination strategies\n",
    "   - Perfect for collaborative refinement\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Concurrent Execution Pattern**\n",
    "   - Parallel agent execution\n",
    "   - Fast multi-perspective analysis\n",
    "   - Simple fan-out/fan-in workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Magentic Orchestration Pattern**\n",
    "   - Intelligent task planning\n",
    "   - Dynamic agent coordination\n",
    "   - Complex multi-step workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experiment with different agent instructions**: Try various persona combinations\n",
    "- **Add more agents**: Scale up to 5-10 specialized agents\n",
    "- **Integrate with real tools**: Connect to databases, APIs, file systems\n",
    "- **Add human-in-the-loop**: Implement approval workflows\n",
    "- **Monitor with observability**: Add Azure AI tracing and logging\n",
    "- **Production deployment**: Use Azure AI Foundry for managed hosting\n",
