    "# Plan and Execute Pattern using Microsoft Agent Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the implementation of the **Plan and Execute** pattern using Microsoft Agent Framework. This pattern improves agent performance by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Breaking down complex tasks** into manageable sub-tasks (Planning)\n",
    "2. **Executing each sub-task** in sequence or parallel\n",
    "3. **Adapting to feedback** during execution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Plan and Execute pattern involves:\n",
    "- **Planner**: Responsible for generating a structured plan of sub-tasks\n",
    "- **Executors**: Handle the execution of each sub-task\n",
    "- **Workflow**: Coordinates sequential or parallel execution\n",
    "- **Tools**: Custom functions that can be called during execution\n",
    "\n",
    "![Plan and Execute Pattern](../../images/planning.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set up Microsoft Agent Framework** with Azure OpenAI\n",
    "2. **Create custom tools** for web search and product research\n",
    "3. **Build sequential workflows** for step-by-step task execution\n",
    "4. **Build parallel workflows** for concurrent task execution\n",
    "5. **Implement plan-and-execute patterns** for complex queries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key\n",
    "- Google Search API credentials (optional, for web search)\n",
    "- Microsoft Agent Framework installed: `pip install agent-framework azure-ai`"

    "## Understanding the Plan and Execute Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The Plan and Execute pattern we'll demonstrate offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Task Decomposition**: Complex tasks are broken down into simpler, manageable steps\n",
    "2. **Tool Selection**: The workflow automatically routes to the appropriate executors for each step\n",
    "3. **Adaptability**: If a step fails, the workflow can adapt by trying alternative approaches\n",
    "4. **Explainability**: The workflow structure provides transparency into how the agent approaches problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern | Use Case | Complexity | Flexibility |\n",
    "|---------|----------|------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Sequential** | Linear multi-step tasks | Low | Limited |\n",
    "| **Parallel (Fan-out/Fan-in)** | Independent concurrent tasks | Medium | High |\n",
    "| **Plan-and-Execute** | Complex adaptive workflows | High | Very High |\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is particularly useful for tasks that require multiple steps or the use of various tools to complete."

    "# Summary and Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored the **Plan and Execute pattern** using Microsoft Agent Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Sequential Workflows**\n",
    "- Tasks execute one after another\n",
    "- Each step builds on the previous step's output\n",
    "- Best for linear, dependent tasks\n",
    "- Example: Search → Summarize\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Parallel Workflows (Fan-out/Fan-in)**\n",
    "- Multiple tasks execute concurrently\n",
    "- Results are aggregated into a final output\n",
    "- Best for independent tasks that can run simultaneously\n",
    "- Example: Feature Research ∥ Price Research ∥ Review Research → Aggregate\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Plan and Execute (Workflow as Agent)**\n",
    "- Intelligent query analysis and routing\n",
    "- Dynamic task execution based on intent\n",
    "- Can be used like a regular ChatAgent\n",
    "- Example: Analyze Query → Execute Appropriate Task\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Microsoft Agent Framework Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "| Concept | Purpose | Example |\n",
    "|---------|---------|---------|\n",
    "| **`@ai_function`** | Define reusable tools | `search_product()`, `compare_products()` |\n",
    "| **`Executor`** | Define workflow steps | `SearchExecutor`, `QueryAnalyzerExecutor` |\n",
    "| **`@handler`** | Handle messages in executors | `async def search(...)` |\n",
    "| **`WorkflowBuilder`** | Build workflow graphs | `.add_edge()`, `.add_fan_out_edges()` |\n",
    "| **`WorkflowContext`** | Pass data between executors | `ctx.send_message()`, `ctx.yield_output()` |\n",
    "| **`.as_agent()`** | Wrap workflow as agent | `workflow.as_agent()` |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "The Plan and Execute pattern can be applied to various real-world scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer Support**: Multi-step troubleshooting workflows\n",
    "- **Research Assistance**: Breaking down complex research questions\n",
    "- **Task Automation**: Combining multiple API calls and data transformations\n",
    "- **Product Recommendations**: Gathering preferences and matching products\n",
    "- **Data Analysis**: Sequential data processing pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To extend this pattern, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add error handling** to retry failed steps\n",
    "2. **Implement dynamic replanning** based on execution results\n",
    "3. **Incorporate user feedback** between steps (Human-in-the-loop)\n",
    "4. **Add more specialized tools** for specific domains\n",
    "5. **Implement conditional branching** in workflows\n",
    "6. **Add observability** with Azure Monitor and Application Insights\n",

    "### Plan and Execute vs. Other Agentic Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern | Complexity | Best For | Limitations |\n",
    "|---------|-----------|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Plan and Execute** | High | Complex multi-step tasks | Requires good task decomposition |\n",
    "| **Reflection** | Medium | Iterative improvement | Can be slower due to iterations |\n",

    "### When to Use Plan and Execute\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use when:**\n",
    "- Tasks require multiple distinct steps\n",
    "- Steps can be executed independently (parallel) or sequentially\n",
    "- You need transparency in task decomposition\n",
    "- Workflows need to be reusable and composable\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't use when:**\n",
    "- Task is simple and single-step\n",
    "- Real-time response is critical (workflows add overhead)\n",
    "- Task requires continuous user interaction\n",
    "- The workflow structure is highly dynamic and unpredictable"
